Version 1.0.x (2026-02-02)

- Added a pnpm-aware workspace wrapper with npm fallback so root and package
  builds run under either package manager.
- Centralized pnpm build-script allowlist at the workspace root and documented
  pnpm-first development with npm for CI/publishing.
- Added a workspace-wide pnpm definition and type stubs to keep optional admin
  integration building without a hard dependency.
