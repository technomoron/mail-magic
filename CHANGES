CHANGES

Version 1.0.4 (2025-09-27)

- Surface request metadata (client IP, IP chain, received-at) to form and transactional
  template rendering and update the bundled templates to display it.
- Correct domain lookups to match `api_domain.name` during form and mail submission
  authentication so legitimate domains are accepted.
- Export `createMailMagicServer`/`startMailMagicServer` helpers and only auto-start when
  executed directly, printing the bound host/port after.

Version 1.0.3 (2025-09-26)

- Introduced the transactional mail model and API route updates so stored templates,
  attachments, and message delivery flow through `api_txmail` instead of the
  removed `api_template`.
- Let authenticated clients upload form templates via the API, aligning filename/slug
  generation with the new singular config structure.
- Replaced the Nunjucks loader with `@technomoron/unyuck` to flatten includes
  and collect referenced assets before persisting them.
- Refreshed tooling and metadata (ESLint/Prettier configs, README, ecosystem config)
  to match the renamed package and repository.
- Added workspace metadata and sample templates so pnpm and new installs pick up example
  assets.
